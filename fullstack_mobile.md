# <center>SARVA Yoga - Fullstack Technical Exercise</center>

Thanks for interviewing with us @ SARVA Yoga, to better assess your skills and experience, we would like you to take this short technical exercise.

Please follow the following instructions to complete your exercise.

1. Create a new private repository (GitHub) for your exercise and add `namle117` as private collaborators.
2. Complete as much of the exercise as you can in 4 hours or less. You can use any language, React, Vue or plain HTML/CSS/JS (purely because those are the languages we use)
3. Be sure to include the following in your submission

- a README.md with the following information
  - A few screenshots of the finished product. Show off that work!
  - A short explanation of what you built
  - How to test/demo/run (if applicable)
    - NOTE: a 'working' exercise is awesome, however it is NOT a hard requirement. We mean it!
  - Any feedback/notes (i.e. if something was hard, confusing, frustrating, etc)
  - Anything else you'd like us to know about your submission
- a ROADMAP.md with what you would add/change if you had more time. Dream big.
- a super-simple test suite if applicable (even one test is a bonus)
- Some form of lightweight technical documentation (code comments are fine)

4. When complete email a link to the repository and any special instructions back to me.

## FullStack exercise

1. UI: build a registration and login flow Android application

![Mobile App](https://github.com/Sarva-Yoga/interview-exercises/blob/main/mobile.md)

2. Backend: Once the User is logged in, allow them to query salary data from an API that will you build

![Backend](https://github.com/Sarva-Yoga/interview-exercises/blob/main/backend.md)

Only logged in Users should be able to get access to this API.

The restricted page in the App should provide a few links demonstrating the API querying capabilities.

Returning a JSON response is completely acceptable.

Extra Credit: Instead of JSON, display a UI that presents the data in a mobile friendly view.
